# Deprecated URLs

These URLs may have worked at one point, but have not worked when I've tried them on the latest version of iOS. These may work on older versions of iOS, however.

- Accessibility → Display & Text Size → Color Filters: `prefs:root=ACCESSIBILITY&path=DISPLAY_AND_TEXT/Color%20Filters` - worked on iOS 13
- General → Multitasking (iPad): `prefs:root=General&path=MULTITASKING` - replaced by Home Screen and Dock -> Multitasking
