# ios-settings-urls
A collection of iOS Settings URLs.

From my post on [r/shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts): https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/i9rjbh/an_updated_list_of_settings_urls/

The starting point for this collection, from MacStories: https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-comprehensive-guide-to-all-120-settings-urls-supported-by-ios-and-ipados-13-1/

For a long time, I’ve relied on MacStories’ research for Settings URLs. However, as users on r/shortcuts began to request URLs that were not in the MacStories archive, I did some digging and found about 50 more. Here is the full list I’ve compiled—the majority of them are from MacStories, but some of them from my own trial and error. I also corrected a few MacStories ones that no longer work for me.
