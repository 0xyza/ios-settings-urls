# ios-settings-urls

A collection of iOS Settings URLs.

From my post on [r/shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts): https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/i9rjbh/an_updated_list_of_settings_urls/

The starting point for this collection, from MacStories: https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-comprehensive-guide-to-all-120-settings-urls-supported-by-ios-and-ipados-13-1/

For a long time, I’ve relied on MacStories’ research for Settings URLs. However, as users on r/shortcuts began to request URLs that were not in the MacStories archive, I did some digging and found about 50 more. This is the full list I’ve compiled. The majority of them are from MacStories, but some of them from my own trial and error. I also corrected a few MacStories ones that no longer work for me.

- [The main list](/main.md), for URLs that work on iOS 13 and 14 (as far as I know)
- [Inconsistent URLs](/inconsistent.md), which are specific to an iOS version or a device model.

If you find any URLs that are not included in this list, or that a URL no longer works, issues or pull requests are welcome. I also respond to comments on the original Reddit post, or you can DM me ([u/FifiTheBulldog](https://www.reddit.com/user/FifiTheBulldog)).

New updates to the MacStories list will be added to this list as well.
